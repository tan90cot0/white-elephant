      story: `Dear Papa,

Happy Father's Day! I know this might be a day late, but I wanted to write this for you.

First, I'm really sorry about yesterday. I shouldn't have gone out with my friends on Father's Day. I should have been home with you and the family. I feel bad that I wasn't there to celebrate with you properly, and I'm sorry for not being more involved. You deserve so much better than that.

You've always been there for me, through every mistake I've made, every time I've messed up, and every moment I needed guidance. You never made me feel bad about my choices, even when they weren't the best ones. You just quietly supported me and helped me learn.

I remember all those times you stayed up late helping me with my projects, even when you were tired from work. You never said no when I needed help, whether it was with studies, fixing something, or just talking through my problems. You always made time for us, no matter how busy you were.

I know I don't say it enough, but I'm grateful for everything you do. For working so hard to give us a good life, for being patient with me when I'm stubborn, for teaching me right from wrong, and for always believing in me even when I don't believe in myself.

I promise I'll try to be a better son and spend more quality time with you. You mean the world to me, Papa.

Love,
Aryan`,

      story: `Papa, aap meri duniya ka sabse bada sahaara ho,
Meri har jeet ka asli aawaara ho,
Jab bhi life tough lagi, aapke words ek magic jaisa kaam karte hain,
Aur jab bhi rasta na dikhe, aapki muskurahat hi light ban jati hai.

Aapne girne se pehle sambhalna sikha diya,
Aur haarne se pehle jeet ka raasta dikhla diya,
Bachpan se lekar aaj tak jo bhi sikha hai,
Woh sab kuch sirf aapse hi toh mila hai.

Aaj birthday hai aapka, ek hi wish hai meri,
Aap hamesha haste raho, aur duniya ki koi tension aapko chhu bhi na paaye!
Happy Birthday, Papa!`,
